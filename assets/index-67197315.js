import{j as e,m as n}from"./index-fd1552ec.js";const a="I am a machine learning engineer",i=`I am a student at Arizona State University pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science. I am passionate about machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I have experience working on various LLM-based projects and CV-related projects.

In my previous roles as a Research Assistant and Associate Consultant in AI/ML, I worked on developing and training large language models for various applications. I also worked on a project to apply deep learning various tasks involving images and videos.

I am currently working on RLHF solutions for LLMs. I am excited about the potential of reinforcement learning to improve the performance of LLMs on a variety of tasks.

I am looking for opportunities in the field of deep learning. I am particularly interested in working on projects that combine deep learning with natural language processing. I am also interested in expanding my knowledge of reinforcement learning.

I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual. I am eager to learn new things and I am always looking for new challenges. I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to any team.`,o=()=>e.jsxs(n.div,{className:"home--container",initial:{opacity:0},animate:{opacity:1},exit:{opacity:0},transition:{duration:.3},children:[e.jsxs("div",{className:"home--details",children:[e.jsxs("div",{className:"home--text",children:[e.jsx("h5",{children:"Hey, this is"}),e.jsx("h2",{children:"Swathi Kotresh Hiremath"}),e.jsx("h4",{children:a}),e.jsx("ul",{children:e.jsx("li",{})})]}),e.jsx("div",{className:"home--avatar",children:e.jsx("svg",{viewBox:"0 0 200 200",xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",children:e.jsx("path",{fill:"#7199AE",d:"M51.9,-65.7C66.8,-60.7,78.1,-44.8,83.8,-27.2C89.5,-9.6,89.7,9.8,84.1,27.4C78.5,45.1,67.2,61,52.2,64.6C37.3,68.1,18.6,59.2,1.8,56.7C-15,54.1,-29.9,58,-45.1,54.5C-60.3,51.1,-75.8,40.4,-78.7,26.7C-81.5,13,-71.9,-3.6,-66.1,-21.6C-60.4,-39.6,-58.7,-59,-48.3,-65.4C-38,-71.9,-19,-65.4,-0.2,-65.1C18.5,-64.8,37.1,-70.7,51.9,-65.7Z",transform:"translate(100 100)"})})})]}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"home--about",children:[e.jsx("h3",{children:"About"}),e.jsx("p",{children:i})]})]});export{o as default};
