By utilizing Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval Augmented Generation and incorporating few-shot training techniques, the system efficiently generated context-aware questions and answers. The video's description and summary served as a knowledge base, mitigating hallucinations in the generated content. Through careful implementation, the model achieved a significant 60% reduction in the time required for question and answer generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing efficiency and reliability in information retrieval processes.",link:"https://github.com"},

A custom dataset was curated to train the model, ensuring that the generated distractors adhered to a similar grammatical construct as the correct answers. The system also maintained consistent length, tone, and clarity in the distractors, preventing ambiguity and avoiding cues that could easily reveal the correct answer. This innovative approach resulted in substantial cost savings, amounting to 3 million USD in the first year, showcasing the impactful use of generative LLMs in optimizing and automating the creation of high-quality MCQ content.",link:"https://github.com"},
