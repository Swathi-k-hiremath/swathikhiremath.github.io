By utilizing Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval Augmented Generation and incorporating few-shot training techniques, the system efficiently generated context-aware questions and answers. The video's description and summary served as a knowledge base, mitigating hallucinations in the generated content. Through careful implementation, the model achieved a significant 60% reduction in the time required for question and answer generation, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing efficiency and reliability in information retrieval processes."}, //,link:"https://github.com"},
